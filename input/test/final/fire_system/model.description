This coupled model consists of two atomic models

1 - smoke_detector:
    the smoke detector has states smoke, no-smoke and sub states where fir alarms is on or off 
    The smoke detector would detect an increase in smoke when the fire alarms are off. When the fire-alarms 
    are on then the smoke detector may detect lower levels.

2 - alarm:
    simple alarms with  4 states. 2 states are changed due to external transition from smoke detector and two states act on vents
    to open or close them by using internal or external transitions.

The control objective here is to trigger the alarm when the smoke level reaches high and keep it there until reset. Ah i think we need 
a third atomic.
